CoNectar

CoNECTAR is a swipe-style friend-making app where users can match with others in their area when both users like each other. Usersâ€™ profiles will display a setting i.e. green meaning they are online and wish to meet up immediately, and yellow meaning you would like to meet and chat with others through the app and possibly meet up later. Once matched, users can message each other through the app, and if the users decide to meet in real life, they can verify their meetup. Stats such as percent of time sending the first message, amount of meetups verified, and amount of meetups skipped will be available on a users profile for others to see.

Through creating profiles for each user, users could set their status to indicate what they were looking for at that moment.  CoNECTAR would then match users based on their status  and location and allow them to message each other.  A score will be calculated and displayed on their profile from rates of showing up to meetings and rates of messaging others first among other factors. To verify showing up, users would have an option to simultaneously press the same button and CoNECTAR would compare their GPS locations to see if they are in the same place. Messaging first will be verified by looking at conversation logs.
